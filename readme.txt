Create math formulas on your posts and pages using jqMath from MathScribe

== Description ==

WM jqMath plugin is a very simple plugin that adds the jqMath library and styles.

You will be able to add math formulas by directly entering the standard syntax of jqMath or by using a shortcode where you can also add CSS styles.

Current WM jqMath features:

   *  Insert directly a jqMath expression on your post or page like: $$y={-b±√{b^2-4ac}}/{2a}$$
   
   *  Insert a jqMath using a shortcode with CSS styles like: [jqmath expr="$$y={-b±√{b^2-4ac}}/{2a}$$" style="color: navy; font-size: 20pt"]
   

The jqMath library was written by Dave Barton from Mathscribe. You can find further information regarding jqMath by clicking <a href="http://www.mathscribe.com/author/jqmath.html" target="_blank">here</a>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

The usage of this plugin is quite straight forward. You just need to know how to use the jqMath syntax. However, if you have any questions please read this FAQ:

= How can I insert a formula? =

Just enter the formula directly in the post/page editor using jqMath syntax or by using a shortcode

The formula is always displayed aligned in the center and in a different paragraph. However, you can try to workaround this with tables or columns.

= How can I change the color of the formula? =

Using the shortcode and the CSS style color. Example: [jqmath expr="$$y=f(x)$$" style="color: darkgreen"]

= Can I change the font size for the formula? =

Using the shortcode and the CSS style font-size. Example: [jqmath expr="$$y=f(x)$$" style="font-size: 16pt"]

= Can I add multiple formulas? =

Yes, you can enter any formula anywhere you want using directly the jqMath syntax or using the shortcodes.
